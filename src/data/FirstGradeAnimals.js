        emoji: '🐬',
        description: `Dolphins are friendly, intelligent marine mammals that live in oceans and some rivers around the world. They are part of the cetacean family, just like whales and porpoises. Dolphins have sleek, streamlined bodies and a dorsal fin that helps them swim fast, often more than 20 miles per hour. 

They live in social groups called pods, which can range from a few individuals to hundreds. Pods help dolphins protect each other, care for young, and find food. Dolphins communicate using clicks, whistles, and playful body language like tail slaps or jumps.

Most dolphins eat fish and squid. They are active hunters and often work together to catch prey. For example, they may herd fish into a tight ball so everyone in the pod can take turns feeding. Some dolphins even use tools, like sponges on their snouts, to protect themselves while foraging.

Dolphins are fast learners and curious. They often swim alongside boats, ride the waves for fun, and show playful behavior, which makes them one of the most loved sea creatures.`,

        emoji: '🦈',
        description: `Sharks are ancient predators of the ocean, existing for over 400 million years. They come in many shapes and sizes, from tiny lantern sharks to enormous whale sharks. Sharks have cartilage skeletons, which make them lighter and faster swimmers, and rows of sharp, replaceable teeth to catch prey efficiently.

Most sharks live in coastal waters, open oceans, and deep-sea regions. They use an incredible sense of smell to detect prey from far away and can sense electrical signals from other animals using special organs. Some sharks, like the great white, hunt seals and sea lions, while others, like whale sharks, feed on plankton and tiny fish.

Sharks do not have swim bladders; instead, their large oily livers help them float. They are important for the ocean ecosystem because they maintain healthy fish populations. While movies make sharks look scary, most are harmless to humans. Sharks are amazing hunters with unique adaptations that make them top predators.`,

        description: `Octopuses are highly intelligent mollusks with eight long, flexible arms covered in suction cups. They live in coral reefs, rocky crevices, and the ocean floor. Octopuses are masters of camouflage, changing the color and texture of their skin to hide from predators or sneak up on prey.

They eat crabs, shrimp, and small fish. Octopuses are hunters that use their arms to capture prey quickly. They are also known for squeezing into tiny spaces and solving puzzles in search of food. Their beak-like mouths can break shells, allowing them to reach the delicious soft body inside.

Octopuses are solitary and mostly nocturnal, hunting at night. They are fascinating creatures because of their intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to change shape, color, and texture in the blink of an eye.`,

        description: `Sea turtles are gentle, ancient reptiles that live in warm oceans. They have hard shells that protect them from predators and strong flippers that let them swim gracefully. Sea turtles travel thousands of miles during migration and can live up to 80 years.

They eat jellyfish, seaweed, and small invertebrates, depending on the species. Sea turtles are slow on land but excellent swimmers. Female turtles return to the beaches where they hatched to lay eggs, a journey that sometimes spans thousands of miles.

Sea turtles play a vital role in marine ecosystems, keeping jellyfish populations under control and maintaining healthy seagrass beds. Despite threats like pollution and fishing nets, they continue to fascinate scientists and children alike.`,

        emoji: '🐠',
        description: `Clownfish are small, brightly colored fish living in coral reefs, especially among sea anemones. The anemones protect them from predators with their stinging tentacles, and the clownfish provide cleaning and food scraps in return. This is an example of a symbiotic relationship.

Clownfish eat algae, plankton, and small invertebrates. They are territorial and protect their homes aggressively. These fish are known for their bright orange and white stripes and their playful swimming patterns.

Clownfish live in small groups with a clear social hierarchy, led by a dominant female. They are active during the day and hide in anemones at night. Clownfish are popular in stories and movies because of their bright colors, curiosity, and friendly behavior.`,

Seahorses eat tiny crustaceans and plankton by sucking them into their snouts. Male seahorses carry the eggs in a pouch until they hatch, which is unusual in the animal kingdom. They use their tails to anchor to plants and avoid being swept away by currents. Seahorses rely on camouflage to hide from predators and blend with their environment.`,
